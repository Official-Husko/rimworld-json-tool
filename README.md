# RimWorld JSON Tool
This tool is meant to help you make mods for RimWorld. I for one hate XML and it's the worst to write anything in it in my opinion. That's why I made this tool! With this tool, you can convert XML to JSON and the other way around. You can now finally write your mods in JSON and then just convert them.

## Usage
0. ***I would advise you to use a base XML template for each mod and then use the tool to convert it to JSON at which point you can edit it to your needs.***
1. Place the file you want to process (XML or JSON) into the "Input" folder.
2. Run the tool. The output will be in the "Output" folder.


## Notice:
***This tool might break on more advanced XML files. If you encounter any issues, please let me know. Additionally, the tool currently removes comments so keep that in mind***
