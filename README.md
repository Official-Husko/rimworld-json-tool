# RimWorld JSON Tool
This tool is meant to help you make mods for RimWorld. I for one hate XML and its the worst to write anything in it in my opinion. That's why i made this tool! With this tool you can convert XML to JSON and the other way around. You can now finally write your mods in JSON and then just convert them.

## Usage
1. Place the file you want to process into the "Input" folder.
2. Run the tool. The output will be in the "Output" folder.


## Notice:
***This tool might break on more advanced XML files. If you encounter any issues, please let me know. Additionally the tool currently removes comments so keep that in mind***
